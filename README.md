# Hang in There  

### Abstract:
This website allows the user to generate motivational posters with an image, title, and quote by either drawing from a bank of existing poster elements or providing their own. The user can then save their favorite posters to a grid display and, later, remove any desired posters from the saved poster collection.

### Installation Instructions:
#### To Clone the Repository
1. Open the [GitHub repository page](https://github.com/JWFeatherstone/hang-in-there-as-jf).
1. Fork the repository.
1. On the forked repository page, click the "<> Code" drop-down menu and toggle "SSH".
1. Copy the generated link.
1. Open the terminal and navigate to the directory you want the local version of your repository to be stored in - cloning will create a new directory.
1. Run the command "git clone SSHKey", where SSHKey is the link copied from the GitHub page.
#### To View the Project - Option 1: Via the HTML File

### Context:
- This project was completed as part of the Turing School's Module One paired assignment, ["Hang in There"](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-1/hang-in-there-v2.html).
- The project is intended to demonstrate competency in basic object-oriented program, DOM manipulation, and Javascript, and to help build a discipline around workflow and communication for a collaborative project making use of Git and GitHub.
- The functionality of the website was built over the course of four paired working sessions. The team used a [kanban system](https://trello.com/b/qC9DSshO/mod-1-paired-project) for project management.

### Learning Goals:
#### Javascript:
- To improve and demonstrate competency with basic object-oriented programming in Javascript - making thoughtful and consistent use of classes, new instances, and methods.
- To improve and demonstrate competency with manipulation of the Document Object Model (DOM) - targeting elements thoughtfully and using the DOM to access and update information dynamically.
- To use, and build a better understanding of, best practices in Javascript style - including adherance to Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) and Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) conventions and a consistent and readable approach to naming, organization, and scope.

#### Workflow and Professional Habits:
- To understand and implement effective working practices for collaborative projects, including establishing and adhering to agreed-upon norms, creating and maintaining a clear working process, and effectively preparing for, and resolving, conflicts that may arise.
- To establish and reinforce a clear and consistent Git workflow - making use of atomic commits, providing descriptive and concise commit messages, and using separate, thoughtfully-designated branches for new, unreviewed code.
- To establish and reinforce a clear and consistent GitHub workflow - making effective use of code reviews, providing clear descriptions with each pull request, and providing a clear and effective ReadME file.

### Wins + Challenges:
#### Wins
- We communicated and planned effectively throughout the project, establishing a clear timeline, effectively managing tasks and responsibilities, and reconciling regularly with the project spec and rubric.
- We revised and developed our approach to collaborative work as the project progressed, reflecting regularly on what approaches worked for us both and what would help us learn effectively.

#### Challenges
- We encountered numerous concepts that neither partner had familiarity with, and initially this proved challenging in a paired programming environment. As the project progressed, we became more comfortable in our approach to collaborative troubleshooting - pseudocoding, using outside resources like drawing tools, and researching and testing building block elements independently.
